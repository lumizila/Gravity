#We created a file CreateDatabase.sh

##On that file we have the bash code that uses mysql to create and populate a database with the information we already had in our file.

####First the database is destroyed if it exists, then it is created and a table is created inside that database with the necessary rows to keep our files. After that, all the files with individual answers are put together into a single temp csv file. We use that csv file to populate the table we just created and put the database into a ".sql" file.

1. the link to the base "CreateDatabase.sh" file is: [bash file](dsadsa)
