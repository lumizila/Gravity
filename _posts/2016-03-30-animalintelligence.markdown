The animals we eat feel pain just like the dogs and cats we love. Chickens, pigs, cows, sheep, ducks, goats, rabbits, and turkeys are intelligent and have their own personalities. For example, chickens are very social and will mourn when a loved one dies. Pigs rank #4 in animal intelligence (behind chimpanzees, dolphins, and elephants), and can learn tricks faster than dogs. In fact, a professor at Penn State University found that pigs excel at video games!

Sadly, every year billions of these innocent animals suffer and die on factory farms as well as "organic," "free range," and "humane" farms. Fortunately, more and more people are learning the truth and taking simple steps to help these animals. Now, you can be one of them!
