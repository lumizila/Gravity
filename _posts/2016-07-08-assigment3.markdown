Because I'm too lazy I wrote only one line of text on my md file.
After that I ran a bash script where I had pandoc commands to convert the file into many other types
My program will ask for the name of the md file that needs to be converted without the ".md" at the end.

just run:
bash lumizila-convert-docs.sh
and then the program will ask for a file name... I typed: 
aboutme


That's all folks.
